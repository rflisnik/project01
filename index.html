<body>on paper<br><br>
    by Jacqueline Woodson
<br><br>
    The first time I write my full name
<br>
    Jacqueline Amanda Woodson
<br>
    without anybody&apos;s help
    on a clean white page in my composition notebook,<br>
    I know<br>

    if I wanted to<br>

    I could write anything.<br>

    Letters becoming words, words gathering meaning,
    becoming<br>
    thoughts outside my head

    becoming sentences<br><br>

    written by<br><br>

    Jacqueline Amanda Woodson
